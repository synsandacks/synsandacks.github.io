Have you ever been asked a question that you know the answer to, but your mind doesn’t let you recall that information at that moment in time? This recently happened to me while discussing Cisco ISE and in the conversation, I was asked if I know the common RADIUS packet types. Like a deer in the headlights, my thoughts were frozen, and my brain would not let me recall that information. Luckily the other end of the conversation didn’t make me feel bad for this. Instead, they rattled them off and as they did, I could see the baby blue lines of RADIUS packets in Wireshark flash in my mind. Maybe it was the setting of the conversation, or I haven’t had to troubleshoot a problem recent enough that my mind decided it was safe to tuck this information away. When I find myself in situations like this or when I’m trying to learn something new, I like to lab it up and take notes. This post will be my notes on this topic, I hope you enjoy.
